1.what is a state?
A.state of a component is an object that holds some information that may 
  change over the lifetime of the component.We should always try to make 
  our state as simple as possible and minimize numberof useful components.

2.explain about useState hook?
A.useState is a Hook that allows you to add state variables to functional 
  components in React. Before the introduction of Hooks, state management 
  was only possible in class components. With Hooks,functional components 
  can now have their own statewithout converting them into class components.
    1.useState returns the object which containsthe initial value of the 
      state and a function used to update the change.It accepts a new 
      state value and triggers a rerender of the component.

3.explain about useRef?
A.useRef is a Hook in React that returns a mutable ref object whose 
  .current property is initialized to the passed argument (initial value).
  The returned object will persist across renders, allowing us to maintain
  values between renders without causing re-renders. Additionally, useRef 
  is commonly used to access or manipulate DOM elements.

  Imagine useRef as a magic wand in React. You can wave this wand to 
  remember something (like a value or a reference to a DOM element) 
  without causing the wizard (React) to redraw the whole magical world 
  (re-render the component).

4.explain the difference between useRef and useState hooks?
A. 1.useState:
       a.allows functional components to have their own state.
       b.allows us to update the state inside component.
       c.it causes components to rerender after state updates.
       d.returns the current state.
   2.useRef:
       a.returns a object with a property containing the initial value.
       b.doesnt cause a component to rerender when the value or state changes.
       c.data is persisted between renders.
       d.allows dom referencing.

5.explain about setInterval and clearInterval?
A.  1.setInterval:
         setInterval is a built-in JavaScript function that repeatedly 
         calls a function or executes a code snippet at a specified interval 
         (in milliseconds).
         It takes two parameters:
             The function or code snippet to be executed.
             The interval (in milliseconds) at which the function should 
             be called.
             It returns a unique ID (interval ID) that identifies the interval, 
             which can be used to stop the interval later using clearInterval.

    2.clearInterval:
        clearInterval is another built-in JavaScript function used to stop 
        the interval that was previously started with setInterval.
        It takes one parameter, which is the interval ID returned by setInterval.
        When called with the interval ID, it stops the interval specified
        by that ID, preventing further execution of the associated function or code snippet.

6.what is an effect or sideeffect in react?
A. 1.the main job of react is to render UI and react to user inputs.
   2.evaluate and render jsx manage state and props recat to (user) events
     and inputs and re evaluate component upon state and prop changes.
   3.anything other then these are called side effects.
   4.storing data in browser storage, sending http requests to the backend
     server,managing timers etc. comes under effects or side effects.
   5.for sideeffects we use useEffect hook in react functional components.

7.what is useEffect hook?
A.The useEffect hook is one of the most versatile hooks in React. It allows 
  you to perform side effects in function components. Side effects may 
  include data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM in React 
  components. useEffect runs after every render by default and can optionally 
  clean up after itself.   
  

  a.Basic syntax:

    useEffect(() => {
      //side effect code
      return () => {
        //cleanup code here(optional)
      }
    });

  b.scenarios based on [] in react:
      1.when there is no [] or dependemncy array:
          if we dont have dependency array then we get into infinite loop.
      2.when there is [] present and do not have any depdencies:
          no changes and hence it only runs once during component mounting.
      3.where are is[] and dependencies present in it:
          it will execute only when the conditions or depdencies are met.
      4.cleanup functions:
          we use it for clean up functions too like unsubscribe or when componment
          unmounts all these conditons like 1,2,3 apply there also
